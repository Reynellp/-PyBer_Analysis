# Overview of the Analysis

For this project we will be Analyzing all rideshare data from January to early may of 2019. We will be breaking down the ride-share data to three city types Rural, Suburban, and Urban. With this data we can make effective business decisions to increase profits.


# Results:

The data set below simplifies the average fare from the total rides vs the amount of drivers we have in those areas. Based on volume Urban areas are saturated with Pyber drivers vs total rides that directly affects the average fare per driver. Suburban areas and Rural Areas have a higher average fare per driver due to the amount of total drivers vs total rides. An ideal incentive to have drivers in those areas due to profits.

Attached below gives maps out the highest and lowest average fare per month. While we see that toward the end of February all three areas saw a lift in total fares. Fares have mostly maintained a steady flow besides the dip April but the total fares increased back to noraml within the month.

# Summary:

- Rural 

Keeping total drivers low in this area would work as great incentive for drivers due to the higher average fare. While ride count is in the lower of the spectrum your team can motivate these drivers to maximize profits by educating the potential to make more money when heading to work or when running errands. 

- Suburban

I believe the margin in these areas are great. We have a great ratio of drives vs total rides which reflects on the average fare per driver. It should be easy to maintain the average fares in this area. 

- Urban

The Urban areas do need more drivers due to the population counts however total drivers outweigh the total amount of rides in the cities. Investing in more advertisment to entice more riders may lead to an increase in average fare per driver. Creating enticing specials like discounted rates during specifc time frame or direct disount sent to the customers apps.
